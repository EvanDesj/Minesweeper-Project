# Minesweeper-Project
This is a remake of the classic Minesweeper game made in Netbeans 8.2 using Java.

# Installation and Running the Project
- To try the project out, simply download and use the .jar file at dist/Minesweeper_v2.jar in this repo and run the file.  

However, if you want to run this project in the IDE I used to develop it follow the steps below.
- Download Netbeans 8.2 IDE from [here](https://netbeans-ide.informer.com/download/), selecting the 8.2 version that is available.
- Download jdk1.8.0_311 from [here](https://www.oracle.com/ca-en/java/technologies/javase/javase8u211-later-archive-downloads.html)
- Install both of these on your system
- Download the Minesweeper_v2.zip file in the root of this repository
- Open Netbeans, click on `File`, `Import Project`, `From ZIP`, and then import the zip file you have downloaded.
- This will give you full access to all the files inside of the IDE, giving you access to the UI editor and the ability to do whatever you would like with the code!
